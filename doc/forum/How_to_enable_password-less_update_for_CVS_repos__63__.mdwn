I use `mr update` at the path where multiple repositories are stored to update them en mass. But now some of the repos are CVS that require passwords. At the moment each time I run `mr update` when it is the turn for mr to update a CVS repo, it prompts me to enter the password, only after me manually typing in the password, it proceeds to run `CVS update` to it. How do I enable password-less update for them?
