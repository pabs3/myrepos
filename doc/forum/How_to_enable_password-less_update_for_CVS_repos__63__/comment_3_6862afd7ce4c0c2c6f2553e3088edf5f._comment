In the myrepos config file, every single value is a shell snippet, there are no boolean values. In the snippet I posted, it is checking if you want auth disabled (if you set that environment variable), and if that is set then it is skipping the CVS repo when it is one that requires auth (ie it doesn't use pserver). The documentation explains how the skip functionality works, but it is generic and doesn't know anything about individual repo types, remotes or content.
