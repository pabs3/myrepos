None of the myrepos committers have experience with Pijul, but if you can provide a patch to the default config in `mr` then we will happily review it and merge it into myrepos. You will need to fill in at least these things:

* `pijul_test`: a perl snippet that detects pijul checkouts
* `pijul_register`: a shell snippet that detects the pijul remote URL and saves it in ~/.mrconfig
* please also fill out as many of the other actions in `mr` as possible; especially `fetch`, `commit` and `push`.
* please also look at the `graph` `remote` `upgrade` `vis` extensions in the `lib/` directory and try to add pijul support for them if that is feasible, where it isn't feasible then add a comment about why.
```

Once you are done, please post a link to the repository and we will review it.
